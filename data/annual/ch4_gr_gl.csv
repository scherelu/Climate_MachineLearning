# Annual CH4 mole fraction increase (ppb) from Jan 1 through Dec 31.
#
# Uncertainty in the global annual increase is estimated using two
# terms: The first is a bootstrap (resampling) method that varies the
# sites in our network. Each pseudo-network contains the same number of
# sites as our actual NOAA ESRL cooperative global air sampling network,
# but some are repeated and some are excluded. The second term is a
# Monte Carlo method that randomly modifies the data to account for
# measurement uncertainty. In both cases, 100 globally-averaged time
# series are created. Standard deviations of the annual increases are
# calculated, and the two terms (network and analytical) are taken in
# quadrature to give the  reported uncertainties. Please see Dlugokencky
# et al., 1994, JGR, vol. 99, 17021-17043, for a complete discussion.

# NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change,
# depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality
# control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also change for the same
# reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.
