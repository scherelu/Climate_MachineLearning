# Climate_MachineLearning

## This is the repo for our machine learning project on climate change data.

### Original datasets:

    sea_ice: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nsidcorg/daily-sea-ice-extent-data
    ave_temp_change: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sevgisarac/temperature-change
    co2 and ch4 datasets: https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/  

### Summary:
    The idea is to essentially gather two types of data sets: growthrate, and absolute value. For each of the factors 
    we are considering (Temperature, Sea Ice, CO2, CH4 so far) we want to acquire the data both as a monthly and as an 
    annual version, to allow for in depth analysis and detection of trends and patterns both longterm and seasonal.
