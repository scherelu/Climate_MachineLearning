# Climate_MachineLearning

## This is the repo for our machine learning project on climate change data.

### Original datasets:

    sea_ice: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nsidcorg/daily-sea-ice-extent-data
    ave_temp_change: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sevgisarac/temperature-change
    co2 monthly mean: https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_mm_gl.csv
    co2 annual mean:https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_annmean_gl.csv
    co2 annual growth:https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/co2/co2_gr_gl.csv
    ch4 monthly mean:https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/ch4/ch4_mm_gl.csv
    ch4 annual mean:https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/ch4/ch4_annmean_gl.csv
    ch4 annual growth:https://gml.noaa.gov/webdata/ccgg/trends/ch4/ch4_gr_gl.csv 

### Summary:
    The idea is to essentially gather two types of data sets: growthrate, and absolute value. For each of the factors 
    we are considering (Temperature, Sea Ice, CO2, CH4 so far) we want to acquire the data both as a monthly and as an 
    annual version, to allow for in depth analysis and detection of trends and patterns both longterm and seasonal.
